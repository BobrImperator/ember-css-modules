# octane-addon-with-module-name

This dummy addon is a basic smoke test for an addon that utilizes some of the latest Octane patterns and practices...

- Template-only components.
- Co-located styles in the `components` folder.
- Angle bracket syntax.

Unlike `octane-addon`, this addon has declared a `moduleName` that differs from its namespaced NPM package name.

To test, run `ember serve` and open `localhost:4200`.
